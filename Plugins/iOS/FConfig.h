/*!
 * @brief FConfig allows for control of server-side config within the app via the Flurry SDK
 * @since 8.1.0
 *
 * FConfig is a config service that seeks to allow app developers to have configuration services
 * over their app.  For example, a developer could bake in a green theme for the day of the Saint
 * Patrick's Holiday.  Further, a developer could roll out, into production, the ability for the
 * developers to test real-world changes while only exposing those changes to the developers.
 *
 * The Flurry Config service (FConfig) is designed to provide the least disruptive experience to users
 * possible.  In light of this goal, fetched configs will only be applied when the app leaves
 * memory and relaunches.  This will guarantee a continuity of the user experience that is not
 * jarring if a new config gets rolled out mid-session.
 *
 * In this basic useage all that is necessary is to call fetch on the shared instance.  The code
 * may then check feature flags with the assurance that the UI experience will be consistent.
 *
 * However, it is often the case that a devloper would like to be more aggressive with the application
 * of a config.  To satisfy that need the FConfig service supplies an observer that an object may
 * subscribe to.
 *
 * As events happen, such as succesful fetching or the activation of a config, the object that is
 * observing may take action.  This allows the developer to have more control over the configuration
 * service if it is necessary.
